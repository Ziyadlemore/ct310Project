	<p>Our group started weeks ago and wanted to simply find dogs who 
	needed help and provide them the shelter, food, and love so
	 that they can grow into the great dogs that we know they can be.

	<p>We do not have many dogs in out shelter right now but are loking to find more that are in need of our assistance.

	<p>Any donations would be helpful because we pay for all the resources ourselves, and as poor college kids, we don't have much.

	<p>Please browse and make your way to the "Out Adoptable Animals" page to view the animals that are all kind, up-to-date on shots, and loving.
